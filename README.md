# Play-Store-App-Review-Analysis

This repository contains Google Colab Notebook containing EDA on Play Store datasets and a Tableau visualization project.

The Play Store app data has enormous potential to drive app-making businesses to success. Actionable insights can be drawn for developers to work on and capture the Android market.

Each app (row) has values for category, rating, size, and more. Another dataset contains customer reviews of the Android apps.

This Tableau project on "EDA Play Store App Review" involves analyzing the user reviews of the app available on the Google Play Store and creating visualizations to gain insights into the users' opinions, the visualizations and insights gained from the EDA and sentiment analysis are then combined into a dashboard. The dashboard provides a comprehensive view of user reviews, sentiment, and other relevant information.

The Dashboard can help app developers and marketers gain valuable insights into user feedback and make data-driven decisions to improve the app's performance and user satisfaction.
